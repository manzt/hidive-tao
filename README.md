# tao of hidive

The Tao of HIDIVE Lab encapsulates the guiding principles and practices that
shape software development within the lab. Understanding this Tao is valuable
for new lab members, external contributors, and those evaluating HIDIVE Lab
software, as it provides context about the motivations, philosophy,
and vision underlying our work.

## Principles

### Software for humans

### Rigor and reproducibility

### Visionary but not magical

### Pragmatism
